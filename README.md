# Clocks

Clock experiments viewable at [benpickles.com/clocks](https://www.benpickles.com/clocks/).

## Development

Run `yarn install` then `yarn start` and open <http://localhost:1234>.

### Creating a new clock

Generate starter files for a new clock with:

```sh
bin/generate
```

Immediately open the newly generated files in Vim with:

```sh
bin/generate | xargs vim -O
```

### Homepage screenshots

The home page clock screenshots are static images added to the repository. Regenerate all screenshots with:

```sh
bin/screenshots
```

Or limit which clocks are regenerated by passing a comma-separated list of clock numbers:

```sh
bin/screenshots 13,18
```
